Vulnerabilities:

1. As mentioned in the paper cited routing on the insecure links like Man-in-the-middle attack, eavesdropping, hijacking etc are most common vulnerabilities while using the Dijkstra Algorithm. 

2. In Dijkstra algorithm, each network link has a cost value to present its status, and this cost is used to calculate the shortest path. 

3. In practical implementations of the Dijkstra algorithm, link costs are assigned in a simple approach due to the hardship of obtaining useful link status updates automatically and dynamically for the whole network. Hence this is a relatively inefficient way of calculating costs and there can be more reasonable ways to do so.
