Testing

Testing is mainly done by using the following commands to ensure all the switches/hosts can access each other in various situations.

Commands:
a. Pingall 
does an all pairs ping and returns the connections

b. h1 ping -c 1 h2 
The first host ARPs for the MAC address of the second, which causes a packet_in message to go to the controller. The controller then sends a packet_out message to flood the broadcast packet to other ports on the switch.

c. Sudo ovs-ofctl -O Openflow13 dump-flows s1 
Outputs the contents of s1's flow tables

d. Link s1 s2 down
Takes down link between s1 and s2

e. Link s1 s2 up
Establishes link between s1 and s2

f. Link s1 h1 down
Triggers deviceRemoved() method and takes down link between s1 and h1

g. Link s1 h1 up
Triggers deviceMoved() method and brings up link between s1 and h1
